# 📊 Job Market SQL Analysis  

**Author:** Abdulla Elkiswani  
**Location:** Berlin, Germany  
**Project Type:** Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)  
**Focus:** Data-related job postings, remote trends, and in-demand skills

## Project Overview  

This project explores data-related job postings using SQL to identify:

- Companies with the highest hiring demand  
- Remote work trends  
- Most in-demand technical skills  
- Salary patterns across remote roles  
- Job title trends and categorization  

“The goal of this analysis was not only to retrieve data, but to understand the structure, grain, and business context behind each query.”

Rather than simply writing queries for output, I approached this project as a structured exploration:
1. Understand the dataset  
2. Define the grain of each query  
3. Apply clean aggregations  
4. Translate technical results into business insight

## Dataset Structure  

The project works with relational tables including:

- `job_postings_fact`
- `company_dim`
- `skills_dim`
- `skills_job_dim`

These tables allow analysis across:

- Job postings  
- Companies  
- Required skills  
- Remote vs onsite roles  
- Salary information

## Key Analysis Performed  

### 1. January Jobs Without Degree Requirement
- Filtered job postings for January  
- Identified companies offering roles with no degree requirement  
- Used CTEs to isolate monthly data cleanly  

---

### 2. Top Skills for Remote Data Analyst Roles
- Filtered remote roles (`job_work_from_home = true`)  
- Limited to “Data Analyst” positions  
- Aggregated skill frequency  
- Ranked top 5 most required skills  

---

### 3. Most In-Demand Skills in Remote Roles (with Average Salary)
- Joined remote jobs to skill mappings  
- Calculated:
  - Skill frequency  
  - Average salary per skill  
- Identified high-demand, high-value skills  

---

### 4. Companies Hiring the Most Remote Roles
- Aggregated remote postings per company  
- Ranked companies by remote hiring volume  
- Demonstrated understanding of query grain and grouping logic  

---

### 5. Remote Job Distribution
- Counted remote job postings per company  
- Ranked top companies by remote hiring activity  

---

### 6. Job Title Pattern Analysis
- Used pattern matching (`LIKE`) to identify:
  - Analyst roles  
  - Data roles  
  - Engineer roles  
- Compared job title frequency  

---

### 7. Location Categorization
- Used `CASE` statements to classify:
  - Remote  
  - Local  
  - Onsite  
- Applied categorization specifically for Data Analyst roles  

---

## Technical Concepts Applied  

- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  
- Aggregation and `GROUP BY`  
- Understanding query grain  
- Dimensional joins  
- Filtering strategies  
- Pattern matching  
- `CASE` logic for categorization  
- Ranking with `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT`  
- Salary aggregation using `AVG()`  

---

## What This Project Demonstrates  

This project reflects:

- Structured analytical thinking  
- Clean SQL design  
- Awareness of aggregation grain  
- Ability to connect technical queries to business questions  
- Independent problem-solving and iterative refinement  

Each query was built intentionally to explore a specific business question rather than simply retrieve data.

---

## Tools Used  

- SQL (PostgreSQL-style syntax)  
- Relational database structure  
- GitHub for version control  

---

## Future Improvements

- Add window functions for ranking and advanced comparisons  
- Introduce salary percentiles  
- Build a dashboard visualization layer  
- Expand analysis to multi-month trends
